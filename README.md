# librnr-experiments

## Experiment folder structure
Old experiments are stored in the `old-experiments` folder. 

New experiments are in the root of the project under the following names:
* `clumsy-<parameter>-<value>`: Experiments with **clumsy enabled**. Can be used for clumsy validation + other experiments.
* `overhead-validation`: Experiments with **clumsy disabled**. Used to validate the overhead of the trace replaying. This folder contains runs with the layer **disabled** (`baseline`), **enabled and recording** (`record<number>`), and **enabled and replaying** (`replay<recording-number>.<replay-number>`).

These experiments cover the entire list of experiments that are proposed in the overleaf document (check Paul's sexy table). For questions or complaints, please contact the contributors to the repo except for Damla and Radu. ðŸ™ƒ

## Before opening Quest Link
1. Connect Quest to PC via cable.
2. In a terminal, run `adb devices` to verify that Quest is connected.
3. Install the BatteryManager app on Quest by running `adb install -g <path-to-apk>`.
4. Start the BatteryManager app on Quest via
```bash
adb shell am start -n "com.example.batterymanager_utility/com.example.batterymanager_utility.MainActivity" -a android.intent.action.MAIN -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER
```
5. After the app starts, you can now connect the VR headset via adb wifi.
6. Run `adb tcpip 5555` to enable adb wifi.
7. Run `adb connect <ip-address-of-quest>:5555` to connect to Quest via adb wifi. The IP address can be found in the Quest settings > Wifi > `<Your Network>` > Scroll down until you see the IP address.
8. Run `adb devices` to verify that Quest is connected via adb wifi.
9. Disconnect the cable from the Quest.
10. Launch Quest Link.

## Using vr_runner.py
### Before running the script
* Add the steam folder to the environment variable `Path`. (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam`)
* Clone Vlad's [traffic shaper repo](https://github.com/Vlad2000Andrei/DistributedSystems-Traffic-Shaper)
* Install clumsy as per [his instructions](https://github.com/Vlad2000Andrei/DistributedSystems-Traffic-Shaper/blob/main/README.md).
* Configure the `config.json` file.

### Configuring the `config.json` file
* `experiment_name`: The name of the experiment. This will be used to create a directory with the same name as the experiment and all results will be stored there under the same file conventions as before.
* `clumsy`
  * `clumsy_scripts_path`: The path to the folder containing the clumsy scripts in Vlad's traffic shaper.
  * `clumsy_path`: Path to the clumsy executable.
  * `delay`, `delay_chance`, `bandwidth_KBps`, `drop_chance`: The values for the clumsy script. `-1` means disabled.
* `apps`
  * `name`: The name of the app. This will be used to create a directory with the same name as the app and all results will be stored there under the same file conventions as before.
  * `exe_name`: The name of the executable for the app. This is used by the `runbench.ps1` script to stop the app.
  * `steam_app_id`: ID of the app on Steam. This is used by the `runbench.ps1` script to start the app. The ID can be found on the app's Steam page >> Settings (Cog wheel) >> Properties >> Updates >> AppID (Below Background downloads).
  * `startup_time`: The time in seconds to wait for the app to start.


### Running the script
1. Open PowerShell with admin privileges.
2. Find the `python.exe` path for your python version Run `<your-python.exe-path> vr_runner.py` to start the script.
3. The script will use the `config.json` file to determine which experiments to run.
4. First the script will launch `clumsy` with the specified parameters, then `runbench.ps1`. The application should start shortly after the `Sleep 5 seconds...BatteryManager`. When the trace is done replaying, the app will automatically close (be patient). After all the iterations are done, the script will close `clumsy` and copy the config file to the experiment directory.
